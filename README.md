# DFS
DFS algorithm A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:  Visited Not Visited The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.  The DFS algorithm works as follows:  Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of stack. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
